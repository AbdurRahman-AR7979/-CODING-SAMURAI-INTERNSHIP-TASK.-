**Introduction**


This exploratory data analysis (EDA) examines the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover statistical insights and patterns relating to survival during the historic disaster. The analysis follows established data science guidelines for internships and is intended to communicate findings through visualizations and commentary.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handled missing values, especially in age, using median imputation.

Engineered new features, including "family size" and "alone" status, for richer analysis.

Verified dataset integrity and corrected any inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics and Distribution Analysis
Calculated mean, median, and range for age, fare, and other numeric columns.

Visualized age and fare distributions using histograms, boxplots, and violin plots.

Revealed right-skewed distributions for both age and fare, with significant variability among passengers.

Relationship and Survival Analysis
Calculated and compared survival rates overall (38%), by class, sex, family size, and alone status.

Found highest survival rates for first-class passengers and females.

Demonstrated that higher fares and traveling with family increased likelihood of survival.

Used bar plots, cross-tabulations, and heatmaps to explore categorical impacts and feature correlations.

Correlation and Insights
Generated a correlation matrix for all numeric features; visualized with a heatmap.

Observed strong negative correlation between passenger class and survival, and positive correlation between fare and survival.

Identified missing data in "deck" and limitations arising from median age imputation.

**Conclusions**
Survival on Titanic was significantly affected by passenger class, sex, fare, and family composition.

First-class and female passengers experienced better survival outcomes.

Data visualization enabled the detection of meaningful patterns.

Missing values and feature engineering were crucial for accurate analysis.

This report summarizes the essential findings and methodology of the EDA, providing a foundation for further predictive modeling and data science exploration.
