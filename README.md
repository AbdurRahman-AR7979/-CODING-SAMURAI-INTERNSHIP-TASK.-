# 🛳️ EDA on Titanic Dataset

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship under **Coding Samurai**.  
It focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to identify key factors that influenced passenger survival.  
The analysis aims to reveal meaningful insights through data visualization and statistical summaries.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze factors influencing passenger survival on the Titanic using exploratory data analysis and visual techniques.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The Titanic dataset contains details about passengers such as:
- Passenger ID  
- Name, Sex, and Age  
- Passenger Class (Pclass)  
- Number of Siblings/Spouses and Parents/Children aboard  
- Ticket Fare and Cabin  
- Embarkation Port  
- Survival Status  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 🎀 **Female passengers** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.  
- 💰 **Passengers in higher classes (1st class)** had a better chance of survival.  
- 👶 **Younger passengers** tended to survive more frequently.  
- ⚓ **Embarked Port (C)** passengers had relatively higher survival percentages.

---

## 📊 Visualizations
The notebook includes several visualizations to support findings:
- Correlation heatmap between numerical features  
- Barplots showing survival rate by gender and class  
- Distribution plots for age and fare  
- Countplots for embarked locations
