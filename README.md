# -CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK.-
Welcome to the Business Analytics Internship Tasks Repository! This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed during my business analytics internship at Coding Samurai
**Task 1:**
**Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Project Overview**
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover insights about factors influencing survival rates. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the analysis covers data cleaning, visualization, and feature relationships.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains information on Titanic passengers such as age, sex, passenger class, fare paid, and survival status.
**
**Key Steps****
Data loading and missing value treatment (e.g., median imputation for age).

Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis of key numeric features (age, fare).

Categorical data examination including sex, pclass, embarkation port, family status.

Visualization with histograms, boxplots, violin plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.

Survival rate analysis by different passenger attributes.

Correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.

**Tools and Technologies**
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

**Usage**
Clone the repository

Open the Titanic-Project.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.

Follow the markdown explanations and run code cells to reproduce analysis and visualizations.
